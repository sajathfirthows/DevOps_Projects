In this project, I have showed you how to install an EC2 Amazon Linux Free Tier instance using Terraform, how to install Docker, and how to create a sample Docker file and also demonstrated how to store the code on GitHub for version control and collaboration. This project provides a basic introduction to using Terraform and Docker, and you can use this knowledge to build more complex applications on the Amazon EC2 platform.
